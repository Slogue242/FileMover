# FileMover

This project is mostly to help me move around files easier and with less hassle.

At the moment it can go into each folder within a folder of your choosing and find the largest file then move that else where.
It also allows you to delete the folder that the file came out of after the move has been completed so no need to go delete the folders yourself after the files have been moved.

New Features:

- Move TV Shows to the correct folder including the correct season.

How to use:

1. Put all folders that have files in them into one folder (source folder).

2. Click on the Source Folder button and select this source folder.

3. Click on the Destination Folder button and select where you would like the files to be moved to.

4. If you would like the folders you have moved items to be deleted after they have been moved select the "Delete Folders After Move" tick box.

5. Click "Move Now" button.
